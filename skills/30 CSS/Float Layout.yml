  Float layouts were the main tool of making layouts since 2001 to 2017 when [Flexbox](/flexible-layout-module-flexbox) started to be widely supported in browsers.
  
  There are two reasons to learn float layout:
  
  1. It’s the only layout mode that can flow text around an element. However it’s not that common so it’s ok to just know that float exists and what it does. 
  2. When you need to work on a legacy website it may have a lot of floats.
