skill: "Favicons"
level: 3

  Favicons use several different formats but the first (and still used) was a Windows ICO format made for desktop icons. It’s basically an uncompressed BMP.
  
  It has the ability to include several different sizes at once like 16×16, 24×24, 32×32 etc. It’s up to the software to choose the size it needs.
  
  Favicon generators create these for us so there’s no need for specialized software.

skill: "Bitmap size optimization"
level: 2
text: |
  Optimization is used to reduce file sizes.
  
  Main factors that make the difference between large and small file:
  
  - **file format**: some formats handle certain content in images better than others
  - **dimensions**: more pixels ➡ more data
  - **bit depth**: or simply number of colors: more colors ➡ more data
  - **percieved quality**: same quality setting isn’t always percieved the same
  
  Most bitmap image formats have some kind of compression in place.  
  
  - Lossless compression is a type of compression that doesn't discard any data from the original image. It means the pixels after decompression are exactly the same as they were before compression.
  - Lossy compression removes some of the information from the image so the image is not exactly the same as it was before it was compressed.
