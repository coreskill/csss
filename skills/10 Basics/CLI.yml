skill: "completion"
level: 2
text: |
  - Completion prevents errors and makes using CLI much easier as you don’t have to type everything.
  - Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to autocomplete command or file name you started writing.
  - If there are more choices it “does nothing” and you need to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> once more to see them. This works for empty input too.
