skill: "Install"
level: 2
text: |
  Both Linux and MacOS have terminal preinstalled. If you want something better than Terminal.app on MacOS, try the free [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/). 
  
  Windows have two command line interfaces: _Command Prompt_ and _PowerShell_ which can be used for frontend development but it's more useful to learn unix style CLI via built-in Windows Subsystem for Linux.
  
  Installation instructions:
  
  1. Run PowerShell **as Administrator** (right click on PowerShell, choose _Run as Administrator_.
  2. Copy and paste the following command `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
  3. Restart computer.
  4. wsl --set-default-version 1
  5. Install [Ubuntu from Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6#activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

skill: "completion"
level: 2
text: |
  - Completion prevents errors and makes using CLI much easier as you don’t have to type everything.
  - Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to autocomplete command or file name you started writing.
  - If there are more choices it “does nothing” and you need to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> once more to see them. This works for empty input too.
