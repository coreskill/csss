  We use a script to confirm events as there are many. This is how to add it.
  
  1. Log in to your Google Account.
  2. Open https://script.google.com/
  3. Click on “New Project”.
  4. Replace contents with the following script:
  ```js
  const coreskillEvents = () => {
    const startOffsetDays = 0 // 0 start now, 1 start from tomorrow etc.
    const endOffsetDays = 7 // at least 1 day, number of days from start to check
    const myEmail = "youremail@gmail.com"
    const csCalendar = "lakf4486bu4f7ksk3l5vogk960@group.calendar.google.com"
  
    let startDateTime = new Date() // set start date and time to right now
    startDateTime.setDate(startDateTime.getDate() + startOffsetDays) // add days to it
    let endDateTime = new Date(startDateTime) // set end date and time to the same value as start
    endDateTime.setDate(endDateTime.getDate() + endOffsetDays) // add days to it
  
    CalendarApp.getCalendarById(myEmail)
      .getEvents(startDateTime, endDateTime) // get an array of all events happening between start and end
      .forEach( // for each event
        event => { // run a function
          if (event.getOriginalCalendarId() === csCalendar) { // check if event is coming from CoreSkill Calendar
            console.log(event.getTitle(), event.getStartTime()) // just print what is processed
            // set your response to event as Yes. 
            // Other options https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/calendar/guest-status
            event.setMyStatus(CalendarApp.GuestStatus.YES)
  
            if (event.getTitle().includes('kdokoli')) { // check event title if it contains provided string
              event.setColor(CalendarApp.EventColor.PALE_GREEN) // set event color
            } else { // if not (rest of events)
              event.setColor(CalendarApp.EventColor.GREEN) // set another event color
            }
            // other color options
            // https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/calendar/event-color
          }
        }
      )
  }
  ```
  5. Replace “youremail@gmail.com” with your email.
  6. Rename _Untitled Project_ to something more meaningful like “CoreSkill Calendar Script”. 
  7. Click “Save” (floppy disk icon).
  8. Click “Run”.
    
  Events that are from CoreSkill calendar with you as guests are confirmed and colored green.
  
  When you run it fot the first time authorization will be required:
  1. Click “Review permisisons”
  2. Choose your Google Account
  3. Click “Advanced”
  4. Click “CoreSkill Calendar Script (unsafe)” (or the name you gave it)
  5. Click “Allow”
  
  Google will complain about security, but it’s your script you’re allowing…

  Codepen is an online HTML, CSS and JavaScript editor with live reload.

  It’s great for quickly trying something or for sharing a problem or a solution with anyone on internet.

  It can generate HTML, CSS and JavaScript from several other syntaxes like Markdown, SCSS or TypeScript to name a few.

  You can enable Autoprefixer for CSS and easily add CSS or JS libraries.

  It has code formatting, basic keyboard shortcuts and Emmet so you can work as effectively as in your main code editor.

  Note: what you see in the HTML pane is a content of `<body>` if you need to change something in your `<head>` or add a class to `<body>` use the ⚙ in the HTML pane.
