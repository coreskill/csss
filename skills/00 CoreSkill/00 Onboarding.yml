  Codepen is an online HTML, CSS and JavaScript editor with live reload.
  
  It’s great for quickly trying something or for sharing a problem or a solution with anyone on internet.
  
  It can generate HTML, CSS and JavaScript from several other syntaxes like Markdown, SCSS or TypeScript to name a few.
  
  You can enable Autoprefixer for CSS and easily add CSS or JS libraries.
  
  It has code formatting, basic keyboard shortcuts and Emmet so you can work as effectively as in your main code editor.
