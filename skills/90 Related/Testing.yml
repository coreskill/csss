skill: "Bug reporting"
level: 2
text: |
  A good bug report should comprise these three essential pieces of information: 
  
  1) steps to recreate the bugs (what did I do)
  2) expected behavior (what should have happened)
  3) actual behavior (what happened)
  
  For websites _steps to recreate_ should include operating system and browser information including their versions.
  
  _Actual behavior_ might take a form of text description, screenshot or video recording.
